A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/


Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project:
As far as I can tell, no one has ever done an income vs. student test scores analysis in Maryland. We are going to try to do one for the entire state. Patrick can start with whatever we have in here. He should plan to have 23 counties worth of data for his final analysis.

Google Drive link that has some of the data in it. I will compile more of it into this folder as I wrangle things together. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1INQ7mIAQ_PwJgA2kSylllJm1KjJwVYNk?usp=drive_link

This allows you to start the analysis by unified school district. You should hunt down the income data by high school, and elementary school district. 

percap_income2023[percap_income2023$variable != "number_households", ]
scores_average[order(scores_average$x2023), ]
filtered_percap <- percap_income2023[percap_income2023$variable != "number_households", ]
sorted_filtered_percap <- filtered_percap[order(filtered_percap$x2023), ]
sorted_filtered_scores <- scores_average[order(scores_average$x2023), ]
